Binaries and Dependencies

Introduction
------------

This section discusses the creation of Python packages that contain native
binaries. First, we explain why building Python packages with native binaries
is often necessary or desirable for scientific applications. Next, an overview
of the requirements to build native binaries is provided. Within this the
context, we explain how *scikit-build* and *conda-build* make life easier when
we want to satisfy these requirements. Finally, we conclude with an exercise
where we build a native Python wth native binaries package and analyze the
different stages of the build process.
